This is Manny. 

![Manny the Manipulator](../manny.png)

He's been to [JSConf 2013 in Amelia Island, Florida](https://speakerdeck.com/rockbot/ai-dot-js-robots-with-brains) and [Web Directions Code 2014 in Melbourne, Australia](https://speakerdeck.com/rockbot/you-can-do-what-with-math-now).

This is the code he runs on.

To run it, clone this repo and then:

```
cd manny

npm install

npm start
```

You'll need a robot attached, and can view the browser-side bits at http://localhost:3000.
